Example 1: Let’s look at a few examples of how the Configuration Converter can help Jennifer, a Salesforce developer at Ursa Major Solar, Inc., recreate the JavaScript buttons used in their org.

Ursa’s Salesforce implementation includes a custom JavaScript button that kicks off a Google search for “San Francisco.” The JavaScript for this button looks like this:

window.open("https://www.google.com/search?q=San%20Francisco")

When Jennifer uses the Configuration Converter to recreate this JavaScript button, the tool generates a new detail page button that is functionally equivalent and opens the same URL.

Example 2: Ursa’s implementation also includes a JavaScript button that uses a “url-hack” to edit a record and set a predefined value for a field. The JavaScript looks like this:

location.replace("/0016A00000MlPFl/e?00N6A00000IF4Mo=MyValue")

When Jennifer runs the Configuration Converter for this button, it creates a Lightning component action that opens 
a record for editing and sets the field with the ID of “00N6A00000IF4Mo” to “MyValue.”
